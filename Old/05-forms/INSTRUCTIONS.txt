In this exercise, you will create an HTML5 quiz that validates form entries andreports the percentage of both the valid (but not necessarily correct) answers andthe percentage of correct answers.1. Open html5-forms/Exercises/quiz.html in your editor.2. Make the following changes to the form:A. Add placeholders to all questions.B. Make all questions required.C. Question 1 should only accept valid colors.D. Question 2 should only accept integers greater than or equal to 20.E. Question 3 should only accept the pattern shown in the footnote below18(don't look if you want to figure out the pattern yourself).F. Question 4 should only accept valid dates.G. Question 5 should only accept valid URLs and should provide a list ofcommon search engines to choose from, but should not limit the answerto those shown in the list.3. At the bottom of the form:A. Add a bar showing the percentage of valid (but not necessarily correct)answers answered. Give it an id of "quiz-progress".B. Add a bar showing the percentage of correct answers answered. Give itan id of "quiz-success".4. Finish the updateMeasures() function so that it correctly updates the twobars added above on every form change. Hint: one way to do this is to loopthrough the input fields stored in the questions variables.Challenge:1. Add code so that the result of the formula the user enters in question 3 isdisplayed next to the input field like this:2. Fix the two bars at the bottom of the form so that they present as follows inOpera and other browsers that do not support the progress and meterelements:You'll need to change both your HTML and JavaScript to make this work.Page 102
