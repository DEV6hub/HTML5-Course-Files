In this exercise, you will convert a basic HTML 4 page to an HTML5 page. The
CSS documents have already been created for you, such that, when you're finished,
your HTML5 page should render exactly like the HTML 4 page.
1. Open html5-laying-out-a-page/Exercises/html4-layout.html.
2. Save the file as html5-layout.html.
3. Turn the page from an HTML 4 page into an HTML5 page. Make sure to
change the stylesheet reference to point to style-html5.css.
