        <h1>JavaScript &mdash; Functions</h1>
        <br/>

        Functions in JavaScript are Objects.
        <br/>
        <br/>

        They can have properties and methods.
        <br/>
        <br/>

        They can be assigned to variables, passed into other functions and returned from functions.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Functions can be called anonymously - for this reason, JavaScript is sometimes referred to as a
        lambda language.
